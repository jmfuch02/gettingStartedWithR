## Introduction: Data Analysis

"Solve this problem... Answer this question..."

1. Load the data
2. Clean it
3. Graph it
4. Change something
5. Send it to 'production'

---

## Problems

1. Data and analysis live together in the same file
2. Updating data is hard
3. Describing what you did to someone else is nearly impossible

---

## Why R?

* It's free
* It has a very nice development environment: Rstudio - www.rstudio.com
* There is an active community of developers and support
* There is a wide variety of packages, which are easy to install
